"# Customer Lead Scoring Case Study" 

Problem Statement
X Education is an online education company that sells courses to industry professionals. The company generates leads by marketing its courses on several websites and search engines. When interested professionals land on the website, they browse the courses or fill out a form providing their contact information, thereby becoming leads. The company also receives leads through past referrals. However, the lead conversion rate at X Education is only around 30%, which means that most leads do not convert to paying customers. To improve the lead conversion rate, the company wants to identify the most potential leads or 'Hot Leads.' By doing so, the sales team can focus on communicating with potential leads rather than making calls to everyone, thus making the process more efficient. This will involve nurturing potential leads through constant communication and education about the product, leading to a higher lead conversion rate.
X Education generates a lot of leads initially, but only a few of them convert to paying customers. Thus, identifying and nurturing potential leads is crucial to improving the lead conversion rate.

Expectations
X Education has appointed us to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Goals of the Case Study
There are quite a few goals for this case study:

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
